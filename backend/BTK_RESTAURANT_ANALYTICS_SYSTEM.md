## üéØ System Overview

**What it is**: A restaurant analytics system that provides real-time insights into sales, products, and performance.

**What it does**: Automatically tracks every order, calculates metrics, and updates dashboards instantly.

**Why it's special**: Combines the speed of pre-calculated data with the freshness of real-time updates.

---

## ‚ö° How It Works

### **The Two-Tier Approach**

#### **Tier 1: Pre-Calculated Summaries (Fast Path)**
- **What**: Pre-computed analytics stored in database
- **When**: Generated automatically every day/week/month
- **Speed**: O(1) - instant response
- **Data**: Historical, aggregated information

#### **Tier 2: Real-Time Updates (Live Path)**
- **What**: Live updates as orders happen
- **When**: Every time an order is created/updated/completed
- **Speed**: O(1) - instant updates
- **Data**: Current, real-time information

**Layman's Translation**: Think of it like a smart calculator that remembers all your previous calculations (fast) but also updates the total every time you add a new number (real-time).

## üîÑ Real-Time Updates

### **Event-Driven Architecture**

1. **Order Created** ‚Üí System calculates impact on daily/weekly/monthly/yearly totals
2. **Order Updated** ‚Üí System recalculates affected periods
3. **Order Completed** ‚Üí System updates completion metrics

### **What Gets Updated Instantly**

- **Daily Summary**: Revenue, order count, top products
- **Weekly Summary**: Same metrics for current week
- **Monthly Summary**: Same metrics for current month  
- **Yearly Summary**: Same metrics for current year

**Layman's Translation**: Every time someone orders a pizza, the system immediately knows how it affects today's sales, this week's total, this month's revenue, and this year's performance.

## üìä Data Flow

### **Step-by-Step Process**

```
Order Created ‚Üí Event Published ‚Üí Analytics Service ‚Üí Update Summaries ‚Üí Database Updated
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì                    ‚Üì              ‚Üì              ‚Üì
  Customer      System Notifies    Service Calculates  New Totals   Ready for
  Places Order  Analytics System   New Metrics         Stored      Next Query
```

### **Fallback Mechanism**

If summaries don't exist:
1. **Try real-time update** ‚Üí Fails (no summary to update)
2. **Generate full summary** ‚Üí Creates new summary from scratch
3. **Future updates** ‚Üí Work in real-time

**Layman's Translation**: The first time you ask for a report, it might take a moment to calculate everything. After that, it's instant because it just adds new numbers to the existing total.
