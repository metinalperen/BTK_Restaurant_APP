# Turkish Character Encoding Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The frontend was experiencing encoding issues where Turkish characters were displayed as garbled text (mojibake) in console logs when creating reservations. This was happening because:

1. Backend was sending Turkish text without proper UTF-8 encoding headers
2. HTTP responses didn't specify the correct character encoding
3. Frontend console couldn't properly interpret the Turkish characters

## Changes Made

### 1. Application Properties (`src/main/resources/application.properties`)
- Added character encoding configuration:
  ```properties
  server.servlet.encoding.charset=UTF-8
  server.servlet.encoding.force=true
  server.servlet.encoding.enabled=true
  server.servlet.encoding.force-request=true
  server.servlet.encoding.force-response=true
  ```
- Updated database connection URL to include encoding parameters:
  ```properties
  spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://192.168.232.113:5432/mydbnew?characterEncoding=UTF-8&useUnicode=true
  ```

### 2. Web Configuration (`src/main/java/com/example/demo/config/WebConfig.java`)
- Enhanced CORS configuration to include proper headers
- Added support for both HTTP and HTTPS origins
- Exposed content type and encoding headers

### 3. Character Encoding Configuration (`src/main/java/com/example/demo/config/CharacterEncodingConfig.java`)
- Created new configuration class to ensure proper UTF-8 handling
- Configured message converters to use UTF-8 charset
- Set default content type to application/json

### 4. Jackson Configuration (`src/main/java/com/example/demo/config/JacksonConfig.java`)
- Created Jackson configuration for proper JSON serialization
- Disabled timestamp serialization for dates
- Added JavaTimeModule for proper date handling

### 5. Encoding Filter (`src/main/java/com/example/demo/config/EncodingFilter.java`)
- Created servlet filter to set UTF-8 encoding headers
- Ensures all requests and responses use UTF-8
- Sets proper Content-Type headers

### 6. Reservation Controller Updates (`src/main/java/com/example/demo/controller/ReservationController.java`)
- Added `produces = "application/json;charset=UTF-8"` to all endpoints
- Added test endpoint `/test-encoding` to verify encoding
- Ensured consistent encoding across all reservation operations

## Endpoints Updated
All reservation endpoints now include proper charset encoding:
- `POST /api/reservations` - Create reservation
- `GET /api/reservations` - Get all reservations
- `GET /api/reservations/{id}` - Get reservation by ID
- `GET /api/reservations/table/{tableId}` - Get reservations by table
- `GET /api/reservations/salon/{salonId}` - Get reservations by salon
- `PUT /api/reservations/{id}/cancel` - Cancel reservation
- `PUT /api/reservations/{id}/complete` - Complete reservation
- `PUT /api/reservations/{id}/no-show` - Mark as no-show
- `GET /api/reservations/status/{statusId}` - Get by status
- `GET /api/reservations/today` - Get today's reservations
- `PUT /api/reservations/{id}` - Update reservation
- `GET /api/reservations/date-range` - Get by date range
- `DELETE /api/reservations/{id}` - Delete reservation
- `GET /api/reservations/test-encoding` - Test encoding (new)

## Testing
To verify the fix is working:

1. Restart the Spring Boot application
2. Test the encoding endpoint: `GET /api/reservations/test-encoding`
3. Check that Turkish characters display correctly in the response
4. Create a reservation and verify console logs show proper Turkish text

## Expected Result
After implementing these changes, Turkish characters should display correctly in:
- Frontend console logs
- API responses
- Database storage and retrieval
- All reservation-related operations

## Additional Notes
- The fix ensures UTF-8 encoding at multiple levels (application, HTTP, database, JSON)
- All controllers can now be updated with similar encoding configurations if needed
- The solution is backward compatible and doesn't affect existing functionality
